# UFO-s
##In this challenge, I created a filtered webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the UFO appearance data by multiple factors: date, city, state, country and shape. I used Javascript to create a filtered table. I also used HTML and Bootstrap to make a webpage interface where the end user can filter the data and see it presented in an appealing manner. Technologies used to create this webpage are JavaScript,HTML,CSS, and D3


To further enhance this study, we could also add time into the filtered data and determine if there is a pattern regarding which time of the day UFO's tend to appear.
